I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University. Before my doctoral studies, I obtained a B.A. in Economics & Management from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc in Economics from University College London. I also worked for the U.K. Government Economic Service on energy price modelling, digital markets, and family related policies. 

I am an applied microeconomist working on topics in health and gender economics. In my current research, I study healthcare provider decision making, maternal health, and policies targeting low-income families.
